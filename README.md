# Software Developer Job Cluster (UK)

This project was designed to represent software development jobs in the UK as a cluster via Google Maps API. The job posts were scraped from  www.reed.co.uk using "Software Developer" as the search query. The goal was to show the location of software development job clusters in the UK.

I am plan to expand the project to include other job boards and analyze further data about the job posts.
